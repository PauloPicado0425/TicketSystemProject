# Ticket System – Setup & Troubleshooting Log

This document explains the full setup process and the technical issues encountered during the initial project configuration.

---

# Project Initialization

## Stack Selected
- Java 21
- Spring Boot 3.2.5
- Maven
- MySQL
- Hibernate (JPA)

Project was created as a Maven Spring Boot application.

---

# Environment Configuration

## Java Setup

Verified Java installation:

```bash
java --version

result: Your Java version 

Ensured NetBeans and Maven were using JDK 21.

---

Downloaded Apache Maven

Added Maven bin folder to Windows PATH environment variable

Restarted terminal

Verification:

mvn -v

POM.xml Dependency Errors
Problem:

Missing dependency versions:

'dependencies.dependency.version' is missing
Cause:

Spring Boot parent was not properly managing dependency versions.

Fix:

Added correct Spring Boot parent:

<parent>
    <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
    <artifactId>spring-boot-starter-parent</artifactId>
    <version>3.2.5</version>
</parent>


This allowed Spring Boot to manage dependency versions automatically.

--

Annotation Processor Error (Lombok)
Problem:
Resolution of annotationProcessorPath dependencies failed

Cause:

Incorrect manual configuration of maven-compiler-plugin.

Fix:

Removed custom annotationProcessor configuration and relied on Spring Boot defaults.

--

DataSource Configuration Failure
Error:
Failed to determine a suitable driver class

Cause:

Database URL not configured in application.properties.

Fix:

Created src/main/resources/application.properties

spring.datasource.url=jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/ticketsystem
spring.datasource.username=root
spring.datasource.password=YOUR_PASSWORD

spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto=update


After configuration, application started successfully.

404 Whitelabel Error
Issue:

Accessing:

localhost:8080/api/tickets/hello


Returned:

Whitelabel Error Page (404)

Cause:

Controller not properly detected or endpoint path mismatch.

Fix:

Created:

@RestController
@RequestMapping("/api/tickets")
public class TicketController {

    @GetMapping("/hello")
    public String hello() {
        return "Ticket System is running!";
    }
}


Confirmed successful response in browser.

--

Testing POST Endpoint

Used:

Postman

curl (Git Bash)

Example:

curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/tickets \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-d '{
  "title": "First ticket",
  "description": "Created from curl",
  "status": "OPEN"
}'


Verified ticket persisted in MySQL.

--

JPA Entity Improvements

Improved Ticket entity lifecycle using:

@PrePersist
protected void onCreate() {
    this.createdAt = LocalDateTime.now();
}


This ensures timestamp is automatically set when saving.
